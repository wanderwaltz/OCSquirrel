OCSquirrel
==========

Static framework for Squirrel (http://squirrel-lang.org) capable of being used in iOS applications.

Requires Xcode command line tools to be installed (see http://stackoverflow.com/a/9329325/892696 for more info).

arm64 is now supported (small adjustments to the Squirrel source were necessary), but it is still considered experimental since I've not had a chance to perform tests on a real arm64 device yet. Tests do pass in Simulator though.
